Pagist Plugins
==============

These client-side plugins can enhance your Pagists.


Pagination
----------
Make your article easier to read by splitting them into multiple pages.

Usage: Put this in your Markdown file:

```html
<script src="http://pagist.github.io/plugins/pagination.js"></script>
```

Wherever you want to split pages, just add a horizontal rule:

```markdown
---
```
